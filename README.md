# bdd-training-cucumber-serenity
Sample project for BDD training

This starter app uses Serenity, which has some great reporting capabilities, but also has its share of drawbacks:
* Serenity does not support lambda style, so your Cucumber step definitions will need to be implemented using annotations.
* Serenity hijacks the Cucumber Reporter, so the command-line reporting is ugly IMO

This starter has the following technical requirements:
* Java 8 or higher
* Maven 3.6 or higher OR
* Gradle 6.5 or higher
